# Interactive-Shiny-Dashboard

From the scripts of a survey we conducted to undersatnd customer behaviours towards shoes, we applied data mining tools 
to get insights on why people would buy sneakers.
The aim of this project is to help a company selling sneakers, that has not been successful yet, to understand the customers
and develop a strategy to extend its customer base.
The output of is an interactive shiny dashboard showing an overview of the project, the analysis, the prediction and simulation,
and finally insights.
